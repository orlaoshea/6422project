## Longitudinal trends in attainment of GCSEs in English and Maths in England, 2016-2024.

### Overview 

This dataset was published through the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and was collected by the Department for Education by matching data from the School Census, information provided by the Awarding Organisation, and information provided by the Individualised Learner Record Database

The variable on the Y axis refers to the percentage of the population who by the age of 19 have achieved a GCSE (or equivalent Level 2 achievement) in both Mathematics and either English Language or Literature.

The variable on the X axis shows the academic years from 2016 to 2024, which will indicate change over time.

The constant is the division of England into lower tier/unitary authorities, which represent city councils and more local authorities, such as borough councils in London. This constant was determined by what local authority individuals attended school in by the time they left at age 16.

#### Research questions:

Is there a general trend over time for the attainment of GCSEs in Maths and English at a national level?

Did the COVID-19 pandemic affect the attainment of these qualifications, and why might this be?
